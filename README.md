The main goal of the mod was to increase the variety of artifact properties. I tried to make a balance between useful, but at the same time dangerous artifacts. I mainly relied on the description of artifacts and their appearance. 

You can always help me with the balance of the mod if you write enough reasonable arguments what can be changed for the better!
